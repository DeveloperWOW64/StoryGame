# StoryGame
 StoryGame: a game where you only need to enter a few character combos to listen to a fantastic story!

I'll list the codes here later. (I've litterally just started developing it!)

# Notes:

1) To download Source code and release packages, click [here.](https://github.com/DeveloperWOW64/StoryGame/releases)

2) I think it is possible to run this game in Windows (I was digging through files and found an exe), but you probably need all the dlls and etc. Or, (which I have tried, but failed) you could run it via VS and MAYBE, just MAYBE it might work. (and obviously, you need .NET installed.)

3) GitHub seems to think 91.1% of the project is written in HTML (I don't think it is) So I searched for HTML files and found one. (274 lines of it.) Though astonishing, (to me at least) I think I saw a file in VS that had 600 lines of C# (At least I THINK it was C# (It looked a BIT like HTML))

4) It is possible to change the 'placed item' (The item placed when you click around.) Simply go to the /StoryGame directory, (The directory with the csproj) And put almost any png in there named "Spaceship".
